# What I used AI for?
- During the initial stage, the data model, framework and app architecture were chosen.
- That data was given as a prompt to ChatGPT to generate the agent.md
- The LLM was instructed to work on the project iteratively.
- Screenshot feature was first tested, but due to errors with chrome and filesystem , it was removed.
- The LLM hallucinated code for various libraries,   I provided the reference implementation to nudge it in the right way
